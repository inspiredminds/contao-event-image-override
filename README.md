Contao Event Image Override
===========================

Allows the image settings of each event in Contao to override the image settings of the event module. Usually Contao 
overrides the teaser image size of the event with the image size of the event module, if defined. This extension 
reverses this logic, i.e. whenever an image size is defined in the event, that image size will be used when the teaser 
image is rendered.
